In order to run, *Hpo Case Annotator* needs **Java 8** to be installed on the computer. This page describes steps
required to check which version of Java (if any) is installed on your computer.


Windows
-------
Open **Java Control Panel** and select the **Java** tab at the top of the window.

Linux
-----

You can determine what version of **Java** you have on your computer by entering the following command into the Terminal: ::

  $ java -version
  java version "1.8.0_161"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode)
