Welcome to Hpo Case Annotator's documentation!
==============================================

*Hpo Case Annotator* is an application designed to help biocurate pathogenic variants published in scientific literature. Each case that is curated will contain details of the disease-causing variants, phenotype, disease, and other metadata. Curated data is stored in ``XML`` format and there will be a single ``XML`` file for each case. Note the things to do for homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations (explained under **variant**). The application is also designed to perform a number of Q/C checks to ensure that the data is consistent.
