  <metadata>Adult heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) individuals have a markedly raised plasma cholesterol that is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease. Molecular screening in a family with FH revealed that three members of this family carried a -27C>T nucleotide transition in the promoter sequence (calculated from the start of transcription). All three manifested a heterozygous FH phenotype. This new mutation is located between the TATA box and sterol-dependent regulatory element repeat 3. As measured by a luciferase reporter assay, the mutation reduced promoter activity to background level. BLAT analysis of the sequence in Figure 1 places the mutation at chr19:11200105C>T. No detailed phenotype information is provided. Note that the mutation is described as being in the LDLR promoter but it is actually in the 5' UTR.</metadata>
