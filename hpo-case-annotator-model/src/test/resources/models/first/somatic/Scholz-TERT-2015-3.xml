  <metadata>One of the most common malignant tumors of the conjunctiva are epithelial-derived neoplasms, frequently termed ocular surface squamous neoplasias (OSSN), which include intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) as well as fully invasive conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).The authors analysed 48 ocular surface squamous neoplasia tumor samples (6 CIN and 42 SCC) for TERT mutations by Sanger sequencing. The authors identified TERT promoter mutations in 21 of 48 ocular surface squamous neoplasia samples (43.8%), including 4 in CIN and 17 in SCC. The mutations (note that the TERT gene is on the minus strand of chromosome 5, and the authors of this publication show the complementary bases) consisted of 8 cases of chr.5:1295228C>T, one case of chr.5:1295228_1295229CC>TT, 5 cases of chr.5:1295242_1295243CC>TT, and 12 cases of chr.5:1295250C>T mutations. All mutations were C>T or CC>TT alterations, demonstrating a UV-signature. TERT promoter mutations showed no statistically significant associations with clinicopathological parameters. Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations are found in almost half of ocular surface squamous neoplasias and have a mutation profile supporting UV induction as the major source of mutagenesis. They conclude conclude that UV induced TERT promoter mutations leading to aberrant overexpression of telomerase is a major pathogenetic factor in ocular surface squamous neoplasia. This entry covers twelve cases of 250C>T in the cohort.</metadata>
