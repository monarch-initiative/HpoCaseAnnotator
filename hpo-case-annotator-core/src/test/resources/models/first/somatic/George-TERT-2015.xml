  <metadata>The authors' objective in this study was to determine the association of BRAF and TERT promoter gene alterations with recurrence and survival in a high-risk population. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the BRAF mutation from 256 persistent/recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma samples (p/rPTC, 202 new, 54 previously reported). TERT promoter constructs were tested in PTC cell lines to determine their activities in these cells. The BRAF V600E mutation was identified in 235 of 256 (91.8%), TERT promoter mutation at -124 was detected in 77 of 242 (31.8%), and TERT promoter polymorphism at -245 was found in 113 of 242 (46.7%) of p/rPTC patients. A significant difference in survival was found in p/rPTC patients with the TERT promoter mutation, which also displayed increased activity in vitro as compared to the non-mutated promoter sequence. No association was noted between the BRAF mutation or TERT promoter polymorphism and recurrence or survival. A drawback of the authors' study could be the limited numbers of patients with non-mutated BRAF (21 of 256, 8.2%). The authors conclude that mutation in the TERT promoter, but not in BRAF, is associated with decreased survival in 19 (24.7%) p/rPTC patients who died of disease and in 38 (49.4%) p/rPTC patients who died at last contact. The presence or absence of the BRAF mutation and TERT promoter polymorphism, however, was not significantly correlated with survival.</metadata>
