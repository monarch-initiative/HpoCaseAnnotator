AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment with traditional risk factors
      (age, sex, blood pressure, lipids, smoking and diabetes) has remained relatively
      invariant over the past decades despite some inaccuracies associated with this
      approach. However, the search for novel, robust and cost-effective risk markers of
      CVD risk is ongoing. AREAS COVERED: A large share of the major developments in CVD
      risk prediction during the past five years has been made in large-scale biomarker
      discovery and the so called 'omics' - the rapidly growing fields of genomics,
      transcriptomics, epigenetics and metabolomics. This review focuses on how these new
      technologies are helping drive primary CVD risk estimation forward in recent years,
      and speculates on how they could be utilized more effectively for discovering novel
      risk factors in the future. Expert commentary: The search for new CVD risk factors
      is currently undergoing a significant revolution as the simple relationship between
      single risk factors and disease will have to be replaced by models that strive to
      integrate the whole field of omics into medicine.
