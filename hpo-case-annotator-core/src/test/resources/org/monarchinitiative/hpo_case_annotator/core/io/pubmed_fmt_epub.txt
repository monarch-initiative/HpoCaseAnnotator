AB  - Long-read sequencing (LRS) has the potential to comprehensively identify all
      medically relevant genome variation, including variation commonly missed by
      short-read sequencing (SRS) approaches. To determine this potential, we performed
      LRS around 15×-40× genome coverage using the Pacific Biosciences Sequel I System for
      five trios. The respective probands were diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID)
      whose etiology remained unresolved after SRS exomes and genomes. Systematic
      assessment of LRS coverage showed that ~35 Mb of the human reference genome was only
      accessible by LRS and not SRS. Genome-wide structural variant (SV) calling yielded
      on average 28,292 SV calls per individual, totaling 12.9 Mb of sequence. Trio-based
      analyses which allowed to study segregation, showed concordance for up to 95% of
      these SV calls across the genome, and 80% of the LRS SV calls were not identified by
      SRS. De novo mutation analysis did not identify any de novo SVs, confirming that
      these are rare events. Because of high sequence coverage, we were also able to call
      single nucleotide substitutions. On average, we identified 3 million substitutions
      per genome, with a Mendelian inheritance concordance of up to 97%. Of these,
      ~100,000 were located in the ~35 Mb of the genome that was only captured by LRS.
      Moreover, these variants affected the coding sequence of 64 genes, including 32
      known Mendelian disease genes. Our data show the potential added value of LRS
      compared to SRS for identifying medically relevant genome variation.
