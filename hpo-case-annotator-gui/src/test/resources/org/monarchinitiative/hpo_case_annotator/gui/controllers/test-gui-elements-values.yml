# This is the template file which contains lists of choices used to populate
# content of HRMD gui.
#
# Feel free to add, modify or remove list elements. Everything will work as
# long as you'll adhere to Yaml syntax and prevent changing list names.
# (List -> chromosome, genotype, pathomechanism... ). That would
# certainly break the program and make you hit the roof.

## Shared among all modes ##############################################
# deprecated
#genomeBuild: ['hg19', 'hg38']

# Chromosomes. Self-explanatory, huh?
chromosome: ['1', '4', '5', 'X']

# Variant class - the root term of pathomechanism.
variantClass: ['coding', 'enhancer', 'promoter']

# Pathomechanism
pathomechanism: ['unknown', 'coding|missense', 'coding|stop-codon']

# Impact on sequence, mainly splicing-related impacts. Inspired by Gene XII - page 521
consequence: ["Exon skipping", "Intron retention"]

# Set the database (please use the OMIM id if at all possible). For
# OMIM, use the phenotype id, and not the gene id!.
diseaseDatabases: ['OMIM', 'NCI']

# Comparability -> This is the weakest evidence class. Enter yes if the
# reason for believing that the mutation is pathogenic is simply that it
# is comparable to other published mutations of comparable type in the
# gene.
comparability: ['yes', 'no']

# Cosegregation -> enter yes if the mutation cosegregates with the
# disease in the family being investigated.
cosegregation: ['yes', 'no']

# Luciferase assay (or the similar CAT assay) to judge transcriptional
# activity. Indicate whether the mutation is associated with increased
# activity (up) or decreased activity (down) as compared with the
# wildtype construct (in percent).
reporter: ['no', 'up', 'down']

# EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). This is used to indicate
# whether a protein binds to a given DNA sequence. For our purposes, we
# are referring to the protein affected by the mutation. Enter the
# corresponding protein if there is a change in binding. Enter the
# Entrez Gene ID and Gene Symbol of the protein that is affected by the
# mutation (usually a transcription factor)
emsa: ['yes', 'no']

# Other "choices"
otherChoices: ['no']

# This is for any other kind of experimental assay that shows an effect
# of a regulatory or non-coding mutation. The categories are at present:
otherEffect: ['Telomerase', 'Nonspecific_EMSA']
